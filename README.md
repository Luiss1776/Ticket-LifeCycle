ASSIGNMENT AND COMMUNICATION 

Once the help ticket is submiited by the user, the ticket then goes through a few procedures to get resolved properly in a timly manor. A team or agent will inspect the ticket and verify all SLA standards are acurrate and in the right department. By doing this, simply go into the admin panel and under the tickets tab, you can verify any new tickets and reassign them if needed. Click on a ticket and readjust any information if needed including, priorities, SLA, departments ticket assignment.  Any adjustments made on the ticket can be found under the ticket thread. After, you can then reply to the customer and see if any issues have been resolved or if it needs further investigating.
