Click on a ticket and readjust any information if needed including, priorities, SLA, departments ticket assignment.  Any adjustments made on the ticket can be found under the ticket thread.

WORKING THE ISSUES 

Always prioritize and evaluate any issue  based on the severity and the SLA provided.  Check to see if you have any collaborations with another agent or team. When ever the issue is resolved you can reply to the end user and click the status of the issue, and initially press post reply. Any resolved tickets will be documented inside the closed ticket tab.
