ASSIGNMENT AND COMMUNICATION 

Once the help ticket is submitted by the user, the ticket then goes through a few procedures to get resolved properly on time. A team or agent will inspect the ticket and verify all SLA standards are accurate and in the right department. You can keep in contact with the user regarding any updates on the issue. 
  
By doing this, go into the admin panel and under the tickets tab, you can verify any new tickets and reassign them if needed. Click on a ticket and readjust any information if needed including, priorities, SLA, and department ticket assignment. Any adjustments made to the ticket can be found under the ticket thread. After, you can then reply to the customer and see if any issues have been resolved or if it needs further investigating.

WORKING THE ISSUES

Whenever the issue resolves, you can reply to the end user and click the status of the issue, and initially press post reply. Any resolved tickets will be documented inside the closed ticket tab.
